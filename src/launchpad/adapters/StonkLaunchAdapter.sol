/**
 * @title StonkLaunchAdapter
 * @notice `ILaunchAdapter` over the StonkBrokers Smart Launch pads — an
 *         IMPLEMENTATION plus one ERC-1167 CLONE PER LAUNCH, in one contract.
 *
 *   WHY A CLONE, WHERE SUSHI IS A SINGLETON. The interface's custody invariant
 *   bans an adapter that accumulates balances or creator roles. Sushi's creator
 *   role is TRANSFERABLE, so its adapter can be creator for a few opcodes and
 *   hand the role to the calling strategy in the same transaction. This venue
 *   PINS the creator at `createLaunch` and offers no transfer whatsoever. A
 *   shared singleton here would become the permanent creator of every fund's
 *   launch — one contract holding every fee stream and every `abort` lever,
 *   keyed by its own bookkeeping. That is precisely the shared-mutable-custody
 *   shape prior audit rounds kept removing from this codebase. So each launch
 *   gets its own clone, owned by the calling strategy, and a compromise of one
 *   reaches exactly one fund.
 *
 *   ONE CONTRACT, TWO ROLES. The implementation IS the clone logic;
 *   `Clones.clone(implementation)` mints instances of this same code.
 *     - IMPLEMENTATION ROLE (the address `TierRegistry` allowlists and
 *       certifies): `launch`, `phase`, `finalize`, `collectFees`,
 *       `quoteSupported`, `nativeFeeSource`, `launchTarget`, `lanes`. Its
 *       constructor writes the lane -> pad map and then LOCKS ITS OWN
 *       INITIALIZER (`BaseStrategy`'s template-lock precedent), so nobody can
 *       initialize the implementation itself and turn the certified address
 *       into somebody's clone.
 *     - CLONE ROLE (owned by one strategy): `initialize`, `executeLaunch`,
 *       `clonePhase`, `cloneFinalize`, `cloneCollectFees`, `abort`.
 *   The roles do not overlap: a clone-role verb on the implementation finds
 *   `owner == address(0)` and fails closed, and `launch` on a clone finds
 *   `address(this) != implementation` and reverts.
 *
 *   IMMUTABLES CROSS THE PROXY, STORAGE DOES NOT. An ERC-1167 clone delegates
 *   into this code, so `implementation`, `lens` and `padSetHash` read the same
 *   from a clone (they live in the code). The lane map is STORAGE and is
 *   therefore the implementation's alone — which is why `quoteSupported` on a
 *   clone answers `false` for everything, and why the clone is handed its pad
 *   at `initialize` rather than looking one up.
 *
 *   THE PAD SET IS IMMUTABLE CONFIGURATION, AND `padSetHash` IS HOW THAT IS
 *   PROVED. `setAdapterAllowed` snapshots the implementation's CODEHASH, and a
 *   codehash cannot see storage at all — so a mutable lane map would be a
 *   routing lever living entirely outside the gate, able to redirect every
 *   future launch to an uncertified venue without changing anything the gate
 *   can observe. There is therefore no setter, anywhere, at any access level.
 *   "No setter exists" is still a claim a certifier would have to establish by
 *   reading the code, so the implementation also exposes an IMMUTABLE
 *   `padSetHash = keccak256(abi.encode(quotes, pads))` over the ordered pairs
 *   it was constructed with: the codehash pins the code, the pad-set hash pins
 *   the configuration that code was certified against, and `lanes()` returns
 *   the arrays to hash. Serving a new lane means a new implementation and a
 *   fresh certification.
 *
 *   WHERE FEES GO: `feeRecipient`, PINNED AT `initialize` FROM THE LAUNCH.
 *   This venue pins the creator too, and the creator has to stay the clone —
 *   `arm` and `abort` are creator-only levers the clone genuinely needs — so
 *   "fees go to the vault" is achieved by the clone always FORWARDING to the
 *   stored `feeRecipient` rather than by naming the vault at the venue the way
 *   the Sushi adapter can. The destination is unconditional: not the caller,
 *   not the owning strategy, and not a function of whether that strategy has
 *   settled. Creator fees therefore never enter strategy custody, which is what
 *   deletes the settlement-dependent destination this verb used to carry — see
 *   `cloneCollectFees` and `ILaunchAdapter.LaunchParams.feeRecipient`. The
 *   RESERVE is the exception that proves the rule: it goes to the owner, along
 *   with anything `abort` claws back, because the reserve is the strategy's to
 *   distribute.
 *
 *   REENTRANCY. No guard, deliberately. The implementation holds no balance and
 *   no role between calls and its only mutable state is constructor-written. A
 *   clone holds value only inside `executeLaunch`, which is callable exactly
 *   once (`launchToken == address(0)`) and only by the implementation; every
 *   other clone verb sends to a FIXED destination — the owner, or the
 *   `feeRecipient` pinned at `initialize` — so a re-entrant token has nothing
 *   to redirect.
 *
 *   The caller approves the IMPLEMENTATION for `p.quoteIn` of the quote before
 *   calling `launch`; the implementation forwards it to the fresh clone. It
 *   cannot be approved to the clone, whose address does not exist yet.
