 * @title PonsLaunchAdapterForkTest
 * @notice End-to-end Pons launch accounting for `PonsLaunchAdapter`, driven
 *         against the LIVE venue on Robinhood Chain mainnet (4663). The unit
 *         suite stands the venue in; this suite does not, because every claim
 *         under test is a claim about the venue's behaviour: that the gate
 *         really blocks, that whitelisting the ADAPTER really opens it, that
 *         the dev buy really lands on `feeWallet`, that the factory really
 *         records our adapter as `deployer`, and that `setFeeRedirect` really
 *         accepts a deployer's re-point in the same transaction.
 *
 *         THE GATE IS THE HEADLINE. `launchEnabled()` is FALSE on 4663 and no
 *         launcher is whitelisted, so this adapter is INERT on mainnet today.
 *         `test_gate_blocksUntilPonsWhitelistsTheAdapter` proves that first —
 *         it is the live blocker, and a suite that only exercised the happy
 *         path behind a prank would quietly hide it.
 *
 * @dev Skips when ROBINHOOD_RPC_URL is unset (shared fork-test convention);
 *      kept out of the unit CI job by `--no-match-contract Fork`, and run by
 *      the separate fork job.
 *
 *      NO HARDCODED BLOCK PIN, on purpose. The public RPC is pruned to a short
 *      sliding window (4663 produces ~0.101s blocks), so a constant in this
 *      file is unreachable within minutes of being written and every state read
 *      returns `-32000`. The pin lives in the environment, as in the
 *      other fork suites here — 0 means fork at latest.
 *
 *      Run:
 *        ROBINHOOD_RPC_URL=https://rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com \
 *        ROBINHOOD_FORK_BLOCK=<recent block, or unset for latest> \
