/**
 * @title PonsLaunchAdapter
 * @notice `ILaunchAdapter` over the Pons launch venue (factory + locker) on
 *         Robinhood Chain 4663 — a STATELESS SINGLETON.
 *
 *   INERT ON MAINNET TODAY, and stated first because it is the most important
 *   operational fact about this contract. The factory's `launchToken` opens
 *   with `if (!launchEnabled && !whitelistedLaunchers[msg.sender]) revert
 *   NotWhitelisted();` and `launchEnabled()` is FALSE. Until Pons either flips
 *   that flag or whitelists THIS ADAPTER'S ADDRESS, every `launch` reverts at
 *   the venue — after the adapter has validated everything it can, and before
 *   the venue does anything. Nothing here can work around that, and nothing
 *   here should try: the gate is the venue's, and the deploy ceremony prints
 *   the adapter address to hand to Pons.
 *
 *   WHY A SINGLETON IS NOT MERELY ADMISSIBLE BUT FORCED. The whitelist is keyed
 *   BY ADDRESS. A per-launch clone would need a fresh whitelist entry from the
 *   venue owner for every fund — a manual, permissioned step in the middle of a
 *   governance execution, which is not a design so much as an outage. One
 *   singleton is whitelisted by Pons once, allowlisted in our `TierRegistry`
 *   once, and serves every fund. The custody argument for it is below.
 *
 *   THE CRUX: `feeWallet` DOES DOUBLE DUTY, AND WE NEED TWO DESTINATIONS.
 *   Inside `launchToken` the single `params.feeWallet` field decides BOTH:
 *     - `initialBuyRecipient = feeWallet == 0 ? msg.sender : feeWallet` — who
 *       receives the dev buy, and on this venue the dev buy IS the fund's
 *       reserve, because the whole supply goes into a one-sided V3 position
 *       that is handed to the locker and locked (the creator gets ZERO tokens,
 *       exactly as on Sushi);
 *     - `locker.setFeeRedirect(token, feeWallet)` — where LP fees are paid.
 *   Our template needs those to be DIFFERENT addresses: the RESERVE belongs to
 *   the calling STRATEGY (it is the pot holders claim pro-rata), the FEE STREAM
 *   belongs to the fund's VAULT (`p.feeRecipient`, named at launch so fees
 *   never enter strategy custody — see `ILaunchAdapter.LaunchParams`).
 *
 *   `launch` resolves that in ONE transaction, in this order and for these
 *   reasons:
 *     1. `launchToken` with `params.feeWallet = msg.sender`, THE STRATEGY, so
 *        the dev buy is delivered straight to the strategy and is never an
 *        adapter balance forwarded on afterwards. This half exists because the
 *        buy recipient cannot be named any other way.
 *     2. immediately after, `locker.setFeeRedirect(token, p.feeRecipient)`, so
 *        the fee stream is the VAULT's before this call returns. This half
 *        exists because step 1 left the redirect pointing at the strategy, and
 *        a fee stream in strategy custody is the exact lever
 *        `LaunchParams.feeRecipient` was introduced to delete. It is permitted
 *        because the locker authorises `launched.deployer`, and the deployer is
 *        this adapter.
 *   Get that order backwards — redirect first, launch second — and there is
 *   nothing to redirect yet; drop step 2 and the vault never sees a fee; drop
 *   step 1's `msg.sender` and the reserve lands on the vault, where holders
 *   cannot claim it.
 *
 *   THE RESIDUAL POWER, AND WHY THE CUSTODY INVARIANT STILL HOLDS. This adapter
 *   is `launched.deployer` for every launch it ever issues, FOREVER. The locker
 *   never lets that role be transferred or renounced. So the adapter
 *   permanently *could* re-point any of those fee streams — the venue would
 *   allow it. The invariant is satisfied not by giving the role away (the
 *   route the Sushi Launchpad V1 adapter took, unavailable here) but by the
 *   adapter EXPOSING NO PATH TO USE IT: `setFeeRedirect` is called exactly
 *   once, from inside `launch`, with an argument the caller itself supplied,
 *   and there is no other caller-reachable route to the locker anywhere in
 *   this contract. `collectFees` calls
 *   `collectFees` and nothing else; there is no admin function, no owner, no
 *   arbitrary-call sink, no upgrade path, no `delegatecall`. A compromise of
 *   this contract is a compromise of its CODE, and that code cannot change
 *   under a consuming strategy: the strategy admits this adapter only through
 *   `TierRegistry.isCounterpartyAllowed`, which compares the live codehash
 *   against the one snapshotted when the registry owner allowed it, and the
 *   factory, locker and WETH addresses are immutables inside that codehash.
 *   Every counterparty a v1 strategy binds rests on the same assumption. The
 *   narrower claim, and the one a test asserts: no external function of this
 *   adapter re-points a fee redirect after `launch` returns.
 *
 *   ZERO STORAGE, deliberately: `launchRef` IS the token address and
 *   `getLaunchedToken(token).exists` already distinguishes an issued launch
 *   from an unknown one, so per-launch bookkeeping here could only ever
 *   DISAGREE with the venue. Every verb
 *   re-derives from venue state.
 *
 *   REENTRANCY. No guard, and none is needed: the adapter holds no balance and
 *   no token role across calls, its only state is immutable, and both venue
 *   contracts are `ReentrancyGuard`ed upstream. A re-entrant callback would
 *   find an empty contract.
 *
 *   HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM A SUSHI LAUNCH, in the three places it matters:
 *     - BOTH the fee and the buy are funded in NATIVE here
 *       (`initialBuyAmount = msg.value - launchFee`), so the adapter pulls
 *       `p.quoteIn + launchFee()` of WETH and unwraps the lot. On Sushi only
 *       the fee was native and the quote was passed as an ERC-20 allowance.
 *       That is why this adapter requires the quote to BE the wrapped native.
 *     - THE VENUE ENFORCES NO SLIPPAGE FLOOR. The factory hardcodes
 *       `amountOutMinimum: 0` on the dev buy. The adapter's own post-launch
 *       balance check is therefore the ONLY enforcement of `p.minTokensOut`,
 *       not a belt-and-braces second opinion.
 *     - THE QUOTE GATE IS CONFIG-DRIVEN, not a feed registry: a pairing is
 *       supported only while some ENABLED `LaunchConfig` names it.
 *
 *   The caller approves this adapter for `p.quoteIn + nativeFeeSource().amount`
 *   of WETH before calling `launch`. Both legs are the same token here, so that
 *   is one allowance, not two.
