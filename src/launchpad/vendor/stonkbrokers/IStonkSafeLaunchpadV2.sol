///                                    shape), and the venue would cap such a sell

///                                    Not vendoring it means no code path here can
///                                    grow one by accident.
///           - `boughtOf(id, who)`  — only meaningful to a seller.
///           - the owner/admin surface (fee bps setters, `bounds()` writers,
///             pausing, venue sweeps) — venue governance, not ours. Its effects
///             are read live through `launchFeeWei()` rather than mirrored.
///           - the events and launch enumeration views.
///
///         PRAGMA: upstream compiles under `v0.8.24`; this file declares
///         `0.8.28` to match the repo. Behaviour-preserving — an `interface`
///         emits no bytecode, and ABI encoding of these signatures is identical
///         across both compiler versions (no user-defined value types, no
///         transient storage, no custom-error layout changes between them).
///
///         VENUE ECONOMICS the adapter depends on (verified live on every pad,
///         2026-08-28, and the reason each member below is here):
///           - `launchFeeWei() == 0`. The adapter still reads it LIVE and
///             REFUSES to launch if it ever turns nonzero — see
///             `StonkLaunchAdapter.NativeFeeUnsupported`.
///           - `creatorFeeBps() == 1650`, `protocolFeeBps() == 1650`,
///             `lpFeeBps() == 5000` — the creator's 16.5% of the per-trade tax
///             is PUSHED to the CREATOR at every trade, and accrues as
///             `creatorQuoteOwed[id]` only when that push FAILS — so
///             `flushCreatorQuote` reverts `NothingOwed` in the ordinary case
///             and is a retry lane, not the normal payout path (verified on
///             4663 in `StonkLaunchRobinhoodFork.t.sol`). Either way the payee
///             is the CREATOR, never the caller. That is why the adapter clones: the creator is pinned at
///             `createLaunch` and there is NO transfer.
///           - `bounds()`: `minStartMcapUsd8 = 1e11` ($1k),
///             `maxStartMcapUsd8 = 1e14` ($1M), `minGradMcapUsd8 = 5e12` ($50k),

///           - `createLaunch` ECONOMICS VALIDATION, enforced by the venue and
///             therefore NOT duplicated by the adapter (which passes the
///             proposal's economics through and lets the pad be the judge):
///               * `startTaxBps == 0` requires `taxDecayPerMinuteBps == 0` AND
///                 `openEnded == true`;
///               * `startTaxBps != 0` requires `taxDecayPerMinuteBps != 0`,
///                 `startTaxBps % taxDecayPerMinuteBps == 0`, and the derived
///                 `windowSecs = (startTaxBps / taxDecayPerMinuteBps) * 60`
///                 inside `[minWindowSecs, maxWindowSecs]`;
///               * `openEnded` requires `sellsEnabled` and
///                 `postTaxBps ∈ [100, 500]`; `!openEnded` requires
///                 `postTaxBps == 0`;
///               * `unsoldMode <= 1`; `maxBuyPpm <= 42069`.
///           - Reverts the adapter relies on rather than duplicating:
///             `NotEoa` (only when a launch set `eoaOnly` — the adapter NEVER
///             does, and could not function if it did: every later verb is a
///             contract call), `SellExceedsCurve`, `BuyCapExceeded`
