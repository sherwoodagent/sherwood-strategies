/**
 * @title LighterPerpStrategy
 * @notice Contract-owned Lighter (zkLighter) perp account. USDG is pulled from
 *         the vault and deposited into a strategy-owned margin account; an agent
 *         L2 trading key registered by the proposer drives trades off-chain via
 *         Lighter's API. The contract keeps the on-chain kill switch: cancel /
 *         market-close / withdraw all go through the venue authed by msg.sender.
 *
 *   Custody boundary (D1): the account is owned by THIS contract — only it can
 *   move funds. The agent key can trade but can never withdraw (changePubKey
 *   registers a trade-only L2 key; withdrawals are venue-authed to the account
 *   owner = this contract).
 *
 *   Settlement is THREE-STEP (G-H1 + C1/C2): withdrawals on Lighter are async
 *   priority requests that mature MUCH later (minutes to days), and the closing
 *   trades' PnL is not known until they fill.
 *     1. `initiateReturn()`        — cancel + both-side market-close every market.
 *     2. `queueWithdraw(ticks)`    — queue the drain, read off-chain AFTER the
 *                                    closes settle. Repeatable, and callable
 *                                    post-settle so an under-withdraw is never
 *                                    permanently stranded.
 *     3. `_settle()`               — claim the matured pending balance and push
 *                                    USDG to the vault, once everything queued
 *                                    has actually arrived.
 *
 *   Lane-B only: the venue exposes no on-chain mark anything here could trust —
 *   positions and margin are off-chain sequencer state and `IZkLighter` has no
 *   accessor for either — so the vault never prices an in-flight Lighter
 *   position and deposits/redeems settle at the frozen per-proposal queue price.
 *   `BaseStrategy` no longer carries a `positions()` / `selfManagesFees()` /
 *   `availableLiquidity()` / `withdrawTo()` surface to opt out of; what a
 *   template says about value it still holds is now `IStrategyDelivery`, and
 *   this template's three answers are `hasUndeliveredValue()`,
 *   `undeliveredValue()` and `hasUnvaluedResidue()` below — the last of which is
 *   how it declares the L2 margin it structurally cannot value.
