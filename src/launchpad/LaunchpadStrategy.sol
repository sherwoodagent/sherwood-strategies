/**
 * @title LaunchpadStrategy
 * @notice "IPO" a syndicate: launch a fund token on an allowlisted launch
 *         venue with vault capital, retain a reserve, and hand that reserve to
 *         the fund's own share holders pro-rata by a snapshot taken at the
 *         instant capital left the vault.
 *
 *   Execute: pull the vault-asset budget -> (optionally) swap into the launch
 *            quote -> acquire the venue's native launch fee in the token the
 *            adapter NAMES -> `ILaunchAdapter.launch` -> verify custody, verify
 *            the declared supply, freeze the snapshot, clamp the claim window,
 *            return the unspent remainder.
 *   Claim:   `claim()` / `claimFor(holder)` while `Executed` and at or before
 *            the clamped `windowEnd`. Dividend-in-kind: shares are NOT burned.
 *   Settle:  convert leftover quote to the vault asset when it can be done
 *            honestly, push everything vault-asset-denominated. NEVER sells the
 *            fund token into its own launch pool — that price is
 *            attacker-movable inside the settlement transaction, which is the
 *            finding-#3 shape.
 *
 *   THE CREATOR FEE STREAM IS NOT THIS CONTRACT'S BUSINESS. `_execute` names
 *   the FUND'S VAULT as `LaunchParams.feeRecipient`, so the venue pays fees
 *   there from the first block and they never enter clone custody. There is no
 *   fee entry point here, no fee mode, and no settlement-time handoff: the
 *   adapter's own `collectFees(launchRef)` is permissionless and pays the vault
 *   directly, so anyone may push accrued fees without touching this strategy at
 *   all, and a later proposal decides what the vault does with them. The
 *   snapshot below is therefore doing exactly one job — the pro-rata claim on
 *   the launch RESERVE — and `launchRef` is public precisely so a keeper can
 *   drive that adapter call.
 *
 *   THE DEFINING CONSTRAINT: this template deliberately acquires an asset the
 *   protocol must refuse to price. Protocol v1 prices nothing but the vault
 *   asset — `totalAssets()` is the asset balance, and the governor measures
 *   settlement P&L as the vault-asset balance delta with no credit for what the
 *   capital turned into. A launch therefore SETTLES AS A LOSS equal to the
 *   quote it spent: the reserve is a dividend in kind to the fund's holders,
 *   not an asset the vault books. That is an accepted product decision, not an
 *   accounting gap to route around; voters size the proposal's
 *   `maxDrawdownBps` to cover the spend, or the governor's settle-price floor
 *   refuses the settlement.
