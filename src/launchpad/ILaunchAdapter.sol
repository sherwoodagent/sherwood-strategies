 * @title ILaunchAdapter
 * @notice Abstraction layer for token launches — a strategy states intent and
 *         invariants; the adapter owns one venue's mechanics. `ISwapAdapter` is
 *         to a swap what this is to an "IPO": the strategy never learns whether
 *         the venue mints to its creator, sells off a bonding curve, or seeds a
 *         pool in the launch transaction.
 *
 *   LIFECYCLE-SHAPED, not a single call, because launchpads disagree about
 *   TIME. Sushi Launchpad mints the token, seeds a one-sided V3 position and
 *   is tradable inside `launch`. StonkBrokers Smart Launch is a process:
 *   create -> arm -> a curve phase lasting minutes to indefinitely -> graduate
 *   -> bond. A `launch() -> tokensOut` surface can express the first and not the
 *   second, so the interface carries `phase`/`finalize` and settlement branches
 *   on the answer.
 *
 *   CUSTODY-SHAPED, because launchpads disagree about ROLES. See the custody
 *   invariant on `launch` — it, not the call shape, is the normative center of
 *   this interface, and it is what an implementation must argue it meets.
 *
 * @dev Implementations are gated the way protocol v1 gates swap adapters: the
 *      consuming strategy requires `isCounterpartyAllowed(adapter)` on the
 *      vault's `TierRegistry`, and the venue contracts the adapter calls hold
 *      counterparty standing of their own. A cloned implementation binds the
 *      gate at the IMPLEMENTATION: consumers resolve a clone by ERC-1167 target
 *      introspection, so per-launch clones need no per-clone registry writes,
 *      and de-listing the implementation refuses every new launch through it.
